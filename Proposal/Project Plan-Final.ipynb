    "ESG is an abbreviation for Environmental, Social, and Governance, which is a combination of three categories of non-financial factors that are increasingly applied by investors as part of their analysis process to evaluate material risks and growth opportunities nowadays. However, in order to better align with the global goals, the World Bank Group rearranges it in a new data framework which further classifies 17 key sustainability themes based on the original environmental, social, and governance categories. The World Bank Group believes that these themes are crucial for financial sector representatives to consider when assessing the contribution of investments or policies to sustainable development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project will mainly focus on analyzing the reported ESG data from the year 2000 to 2020. We would like to see which region or continent is the most sustainable based on the assessment and whether there is any correlation among the three categories. Also, any events that are not included in the assessing framework but would influence the whole sustainability result is also the question that we would like to pay attention to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our data here, we keep the division of the three parts: Environmental, Social, and Governance. The Environmental part encompasses key themes that focus on the economic performance given a country’s natural resource endowment, management and supplementation, and also accounts for other factors such as food security for stable long-term economic growth. For the Social part, it indicates how good a country’s performance is on its efficacy in meeting the basic needs of its population and reducing poverty, management of social and equity issues and investment in human capital and productivity. For the Governance part, it evaluates a country’s sustainability by its institutional capacity to support long-term development, including political, financial and legal aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation of collecting this data is to study how large the gap among countries all over the world would have on their development and sustainability in these three aspects and what factors may contribute to such a situation. The things that we can potentially learn is what changes the country with lower sustainability can make to improve their current status and the overall developing trend of the world as a whole."

Under the environment part, we have `Population density` and `Forest area`. Governance variables include `GDP growth (annual %)` and `Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate (%)`. Lastly, social variables consist of `Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking`, `Life expectancy at birth, total (years)`, `Unemployment, total (% of total labor force)`, and `Access to electricity (% of population)`. Thus, there are 168 different values of variables for each country. "
