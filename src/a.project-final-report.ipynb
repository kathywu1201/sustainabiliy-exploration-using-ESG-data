    "This report mainly investigates the sustainability of countries through Environment, Social, and Governance aspects and analyzes the variation among the principal components of each country. The motive is to find out which country is most sustainable during the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak. According to Principle Component Analysis, there are no significant changes in the chosen ESG variables during the pandemic. Although the variation of GDP growth is thought to be an influential component, it doesn't affect the result a lot. Hence, a new sustainability score evaluation method is used and Vietnam is considered the most sustainable country in 2019 and 2020."

    "ESG is an abbreviation for Environmental, Social, and Governance ---- a combination of three categories of non-financial factors that are increasingly applied by investors as part of their analysis process to evaluate material risks and growth opportunities nowadays. However, to better align with the global goals, the World Bank Group rearranges it into a new data frame that further classifies 17 key sustainability themes based on the original environmental, social, and governance categories, which some of the key themes are shown in the image below (image credit: bondevalue.com). \n",

    "The World Bank Group believes that these themes are crucial for financial sector representatives to consider when assessing the contribution of investments or policies to sustainable development. Based on the [ESG Score Evaluation](https://www.gobyinc.com/esg-scores-why-they-matter/), an ESG score ranging from 0 to 100 will be assigned. Usually, a score of less than 50 will be regarded as poor performance and a score of more than 70 will be considered as excellent performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "At the beginning of 2020, a worldwide pandemic hit hard across the world. Economic fallout, the unemployment rate remained high, people suffered from living hardships, and the decline in GDP growth is also inevitable. This decrease can be shown in the estimated density plot of GDP Growth below for the year 2019 and 2020.\n",

    "<center><img src = 'gdp_growth.svg' style = 'width:500px'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the estimated density of GDP growth is observed to be a significant difference for two years, this project will focus on comparing various aspects of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) categories for most countries before and after the existence of a pandemic and how each variable drives the variation of the data. Using Principal Components Analysis to discover which ESG key factors would have a larger influence, as well as, whether they cause any effects on the accuracy of the ESG Score Evaluation Method. However, the result reveals that there are no significant changes in the distribution of the selected ESG variables, which suggests that the accuracy of the ESG Scoring Method is relatively objective and will not be easily swayed by such unexpected incidents as COVID-19. Furthermore, a new scoring method adapted based on the original system is created to study the sustainability of each country during 2019 and 2020, which finds out the most sustainable one with the highest sum of variable scores.\n",

    "Exploratory analysis on multiple variables is applied while dealing with the dataset, such as examining correlation structure and computing and selecting principal components. A heatmap is made among all variables from the original dataset to explore the correlation and discard some unnecessary components. Then, 11 variables are chosen among 3 big categories from the dataset and ran PCA analysis. Principal Components Analysis(PCA) is to find variable combinations that capture large portions of the variation and covariation in our dataset. PCA can also capture the changes in the variation and covariation of the components in specific years such as 2019 to 2020 when there was a global Covid-19 outbreak, and see whether there are any changes in the weighted components affected by the pandemic. To further compare the sustainability of each country, all evaluated variables are ranked and assigned a score from 1 to 5 based on their positions of ranking quantiles in the overall sorted numeric value list. The sum of scores for all variables will be calculated for each country ranging from 5 to 55 and then, based on the original ESG Score Evaluation, the countries with the highest sum of scores will be the ones that have the most sustainable performance generally."

The second explains both Governance and Social Topics, however, the absolute loading value of *Labor rate* is much higher, hence it predominantly explains the Governance Topic."

    "## 4. Discussion\n",
    "This project analyzes the sustainability from 2019 to 2020, to see how each country's sustainability changed affected by the COVID. Since the GDP is the most changeable variable through the years, the analysis first focused on the GDP growth before and after the pandemic, which is 2019 and 2020(Figure 1). Next, to identify both individual ESG variables that reflect corresponding shifts in average values(Figure 2) to locate which variable has the greatest changes. By applying and plotting the PCs(Figure 3), the graph shows that GDP growth doesn't have mainly effect on the sustainbility。 Conversely, the variables Access to Electricity, Access to Clean Fuel and Mortality Rate and Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate are the greatest affection variables to the sustainability. Moreover, the scatterplot shows that from 2019 to 2020, there are no significant changes to these weighted variables. Thus, based on the original evaluation method, we set up a new method(table 3) that is based on a currently existing well-established ESG Scores calculation. To analyze which is the most sustainable country before and after the existence of a pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis suggests that from 2019 to 2020, the relationship between each ESG variable did not have any changes. Access to energy (electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking), which represent a country's technology and development level, is more relative to sustainability compared to other ESG variables(PC1 is typically slightly negative). In contrast, for such a well-developed country, its mortality rate will be lower than other developing countries. For example, based on the ESG Scores calculation, Luxembourg, which is a developed county, is more sustainable than other countries. Furthermore, the labor rate is also relative to sustainability compared to other ESG variables(PC2 is typically slightly negative). In comparison, the population density will be lower since if the supply of labor doesn't change, when population density goes up, the demand for labor will also go up, which will create a shortage in the labor market and lower the labor rate. For example, Vietnam. Many of the manufacturers are moving away from China and consider Vietnam as a lower-cost, reliable and quality source of parts, materials, and manufactured components. This will provide more job opportunities for Vietnam's people and increase the labor rate of the country, which also matches the result of the ESG Scores calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is not discussed here, this dataset can probably be used to predict the GDP Growth for each country using the other non-financial key factors in this ESG dataset. Accessing the whole ESG dataset would have an adequate amount of data to construct a model for prediction."
